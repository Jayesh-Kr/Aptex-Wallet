---

### 2. ✅ Wallet ID Registration
**File Updated**: `frontend/src/components/RegisterWallet.tsx`

**Features Integrated**:
- ✅ Check if user already has wallet ID registered (on component mount)
- ✅ Validate wallet ID format (3-50 chars, alphanumeric + @.-_)
- ✅ Check if wallet ID is already taken before registration
- ✅ Sign transaction with user's private key from localStorage

- ✅ Identity verification system (mock, for future use)

**Contract Function Used**: `register_wallet_id()`  
**View Functions Used**: `get_wallet_id_by_address()`, `get_address_by_wallet_id()`

**User Flow**:
1. User opens Registration modal
2. System checks if wallet ID exists for current address
3. If not registered → User enters desired wallet ID
4. System validates format and checks availability
5. User signs transaction → Wallet ID registered on-chain
6. Success message with TX hash → Auto-close after 3s

---

### 3. ✅ UPI ID Registration System
**File Updated**: `frontend/src/components/UpiMappingSection.tsx`

**Features Integrated**:
- ✅ Check if user already has UPI ID registered (on component mount)
- ✅ Validate UPI ID format (username@provider)
- ✅ Check if UPI ID is already taken before registration
- ✅ Sign transaction with user's private key
- ✅ Register UPI ID on-chain via contract
- ✅ Display current wallet address mapping
- ✅ Parse and display contract error messages
- ✅ Toast notifications for success/failure
- ✅ Disable UI if UPI ID already registered
- ✅ Success/error state management

**Contract Function Used**: `register_upi_id()`  
**View Functions Used**: `get_upi_id_by_address()`, `get_address_by_upi_id()`

**User Flow**:
1. User navigates to UPI Mapping section
2. System checks if UPI ID exists for current address
3. If not registered → User enters UPI ID (e.g., user@paytm)
4. System validates format and checks availability
5. User signs transaction → UPI ID registered on-chain
6. Success message → UPI ID now mapped to wallet address

## 🔄 In Progress (1/13)

### 4. 🔄 Real Transaction Sending (NEXT)
**File to Update**: `frontend/src/components/SendTransaction.tsx`

**Features to Implement**:
- [ ] Real APT coin transfer using Aptos SDK
- [ ] Auto-detect recipient type (address / wallet ID / UPI ID)
- [ ] Resolve wallet ID → address via contract
- [ ] Resolve UPI ID → address via contract
- [ ] Gas estimation before transaction
- [ ] Low balance warning (balance < amount + gas)
- [ ] Transaction signing with private key
- [ ] Transaction submission and confirmation
- [ ] Display transaction hash
- [ ] Error handling for insufficient balance, invalid recipient

**Contract Functions Needed**: None (native coin transfer)  
**View Functions Needed**: `get_address_by_wallet_id()`, `get_address_by_upi_id()`  
**Helper Functions Needed**: `resolveRecipient()`, `estimateGas()`, `checkSufficientBalance()`

## 🔑 Key Achievements

### ✅ Solid Foundation
- Complete contract utility layer with all functions
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout
- Zero compilation errors
- Clean, maintainable code structure

### ✅ Core Identity Features Working
- Wallet ID registration (username-based addressing)
- UPI ID registration (familiar payment method)
- Both prevent duplicates and check availability

### ✅ Best Practices Followed
- Private key handling from localStorage
- Transaction signing with proper Account objects
- Error parsing and user-friendly messages
- Loading states and success confirmations
- Toast notifications for user feedback

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Security Considerations:
- ✅ Private keys stored in localStorage (local wallet management)
- ✅ Transaction signing happens client-side
- ✅ No private keys sent over network
- ⚠️ Identity verification is currently mock (needs backend)

### Contract Assumptions:
- ✅ Contract already deployed on devnet
- ✅ Contract address hardcoded in `contractUtils.ts`
- ✅ No initialization required (admin already initialized)
- ✅ Using devnet for testing

### User Experience:
- ✅ Clear success/error messages
- ✅ Transaction hashes displayed
- ✅ Duplicate prevention
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ Disabled states when already registered

## 📝 Technical Debt & Future Improvements

1. **Gas Estimation**: Currently returns default values, needs proper simulation
2. **Event Listening**: Not implemented yet (using polling instead)
3. **Error Recovery**: Could add retry mechanisms for failed transactions
4. **Caching**: Could cache view function results to reduce RPC calls
5. **Batch Operations**: Could support bulk wallet/UPI ID lookups
6. **Transaction Queue**: Could queue multiple transactions
7. **Offline Support**: Could cache data for offline viewing

## 🎉 Summary

We've successfully built the foundation for full smart contract integration! The contract utility layer is complete, and core identity features (Wallet ID and UPI ID registration) are working. Users can now register human-readable identifiers for their wallet addresses on-chain.

**Next up**: Implementing real APT transfers with auto-detection of recipient types! 🚀
