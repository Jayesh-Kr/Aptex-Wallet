# Aptos Wallet with EMI, NFT & INR Integration

## 🔑 Core Wallet (Baseline Features)

-   **Account Management**: Create, import, and manage Aptos wallets
    (mnemonic / hardware wallet integration).
-   **Transactions**: Send/receive crypto seamlessly cross-borders.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 💡 Differentiators (Your Add-ons)`

### 1. **EMI Option (Crypto-based EMI)**

-   Users can buy products/services and pay in **monthly installments**
    (in Aptos tokens).
-   Smart contract tracks installment schedule + auto-debits from
    wallet.
-   Merchants receive upfront payment via liquidity pool / protocol.
-   Add **credit score logic on-chain** (track timely repayments, reward
    system for good repayment).

### 2. **NFT Collectibles**

-   Wallet doubles as an **NFT showcase**.
-   Users can view, store, and trade their Aptos-based NFT
    collectibles.
-   Merchants or partners can issue NFTs as loyalty rewards or
    proof-of-participation.

### 3. **Fiat INR Integration (via UPI Mapping & API Price Feed)**

-   Map **UPI ID ↔ Aptos public key**.
-   When a user enters an amount in INR, the wallet fetches the
    **real-time INR↔APT rate** via an API.
-   Example: User types ₹1,000 → wallet auto-calculates equivalent APT
    and sends/receives that.
-   Receiver sees both **APT value + INR equivalent**.
-   Bridges **on/off ramps** through UPI payments, but keeps APT as the
    settlement layer.
-   No need for INR stablecoins --- just **price mapping with live
    rates**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🌍 Extended Features

-   **Salary Streaming in Aptos**: Employers can stream salaries in APT,
    while employees see their balance in INR equivalent (real-time
    conversion).
-   **Cross-border Remittance**: User abroad sends USDT/USDC → converted
    to APT → recipient in India sees INR value and withdraws via UPI.
-   **Subscriptions & Smart Payments**: Recurring payments set in INR
    but executed in APT (auto-converted at current rate).
-   **Merchant Support**: Merchants list prices in INR, customers pay in
    APT (conversion handled automatically).
-   **Payment Splits**: Enable group bill payments or EMI splits where
    amounts are shown in INR but settled in APT.
