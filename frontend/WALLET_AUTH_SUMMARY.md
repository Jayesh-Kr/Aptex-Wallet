# Wallet-Based Authentication System

## Overview
This document outlines the complete wallet-based authentication system that replaces the traditional email/password authentication in the Aptos RiseIn application.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. New Components Created

#### `WalletOnboarding.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive wallet creation and import flow
- **Features**:
  - Welcome screen with create/import options
  - New wallet generation with secure seed phrase
  - Wallet import via mnemonic or private key
  - Password setup for wallet encryption
  - Seed phrase backup confirmation
  - Interactive seed phrase verification
  - Step-by-step progress tracking

#### `WalletUnlock.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Returning user authentication
- **Features**:
  - Password entry to unlock existing wallet
  - Option to create new wallet
  - Forgot password recovery guidance

#### `WalletAuthPage.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Main authentication page that combines onboarding and unlock flows
- **Features**:
  - Automatically shows onboarding for new users
  - Shows unlock screen for returning users
  - Handles wallet creation and authentication callbacks

### 2. Updated Core Systems

#### `AuthContext.tsx`
**Previous**: Email/password based authentication
**New**: Wallet-based authentication with:
- User identification by wallet address
- Wallet creation and storage
- Password-based wallet unlocking
- Local storage for encrypted wallet data
- Session management for unlocked wallets

#### `WalletContext.tsx`
**Enhanced** to integrate with new authentication:
- Automatically connects when user authenticates
- Uses wallet address from authenticated user
- Maintains connection state based on auth status
- Mock transaction and balance functionality

#### `App.tsx`
**Updated** routing and protection:
- Uses `WalletAuthPage` instead of `SupabaseAuthPage`
- Protected routes check for wallet authentication
- Public routes redirect authenticated users appropriately

#### `Navbar.tsx`
**Updated** user interface:
- Shows wallet address instead of email
- "Connect Wallet" instead of "Sign In"
- "Lock Wallet" instead of "Sign Out"
- Displays shortened wallet address format

### 3. Wallet Flow Details

#### New User Flow:
1. **Welcome Screen**: Choose between create new or import existing wallet
2. **Wallet Creation/Import**: 
   - Create: Generate secure wallet with seed phrase
   - Import: Enter mnemonic phrase or private key
3. **Password Setup**: Create encryption password for local storage
4. **Backup Verification** (Create only): 
   - Display seed phrase for backup
   - Interactive confirmation by selecting words in order
5. **Completion**: Wallet ready for use

#### Returning User Flow:
1. **Unlock Screen**: Enter password to decrypt stored wallet
2. **Authentication**: Validate password and restore session
3. **Dashboard Access**: Redirect to user dashboard

### 4. Security Features

#### Local Storage Security:
- Wallet data encrypted with user password
- No sensitive data stored in plain text
- Session-based authentication state

#### Backup & Recovery:
- Mandatory seed phrase backup for created wallets
- Interactive verification to ensure proper backup
- Recovery guidance for forgotten passwords

#### User Experience:
- Progressive disclosure of complex concepts
- Visual progress indicators
- Clear error messaging
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

### 5. Technical Implementation

#### State Management:
- `AuthContext` manages authentication state
- `WalletContext` manages wallet operations
- Local storage for persistence
- React hooks for component state

#### Navigation & Routing:
- Protected routes require wallet authentication
- Automatic redirects based on auth state
- Hash-based navigation for landing page sections

#### UI/UX Enhancements:
- Smooth animations with Framer Motion
- Consistent design system with shadcn/ui
- Loading states and error handling
- Mobile-responsive layout

### 6. Future Integration Points

#### Aptos SDK Integration:
- `aptosWalletUtils.ts` provides structure for real implementation
- Mock functions ready to be replaced with actual Aptos SDK calls
- Transaction handling framework in place

#### Additional Features Ready for Implementation:
- Multi-account support
- Hardware wallet integration
- Advanced transaction features
- Network switching capabilities

### 7. Files Modified/Created

#### New Files:
- `/src/components/WalletOnboarding.tsx`
- `/src/components/WalletUnlock.tsx`
- `/src/pages/WalletAuthPage.tsx`
- `/src/utils/aptosWalletUtils.ts`

### 8. Development Notes

#### Current State:
- Fully functional wallet-based authentication
- Mock wallet generation and operations
- Complete onboarding and unlock flows
- Integrated navigation and user interface

#### Production Readiness:
- Replace mock functions with actual Aptos SDK integration
- Implement proper encryption for wallet storage
