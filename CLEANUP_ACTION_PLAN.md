# Complete LocalStorage Cleanup - Action Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Actions

### 1. Deleted Mock Storage Files
All the following localStorage mock files have been successfully deleted:
- `balanceStorage.ts` - Mocked balance tracking in localStorage
- `transactionStorage.ts` - Mocked transaction history in localStorage  
- `paymentRequestStorage.ts` - Mocked payment requests in localStorage
- `upiStorage.ts` - Mocked UPI ID registration in localStorage
- `billSplitStorage.ts` - Mocked bill splitting in localStorage
- `nftStorage.ts` - Mocked NFT rewards in localStorage
- `receiveTransactionUtils.ts` - Mocked receiving transactions in localStorage

### 2. Preserved Wallet Creation Storage
- **`walletUtils.ts`** remains intact and continues to store:
  - Seed phrases
  - Wallet accounts (addresses, public/private keys)
  - Current account index
- **Important**: `getAccountBalance()` and `getAccountTransactions()` in this file already use real blockchain calls via Aptos SDK

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Files That Now Have Broken Imports

The following components import the deleted mock storage files and need to be updated:

### High Priority Components (Core Functionality)
1. **SendTransaction.tsx**
   - Imports: `transactionStorage`, `balanceStorage`, `nftStorage`, `upiStorage`
   - **Fix**: Remove all mock storage logic, implement real Aptos SDK transactions
   - **Status**: File is currently corrupted and needs recreation

2. **TransactionHistory.tsx**
   - Imports: `transactionStorage`
   - **Fix**: Use only `getAccountTransactions()` from `walletUtils.ts` (already uses real blockchain)
   
3. **ReceiveTransaction.tsx**
   - Imports: `receiveTransactionUtils`, `balanceStorage`
   - **Fix**: Remove simulate functionality, keep only QR code display

### Medium Priority Components (Additional Features)
4. **RequestMoney.tsx**
   - Imports: `receiveTransactionUtils`
   - **Fix**: Temporarily disable or show "Coming Soon"

5. **SendPaymentRequest.tsx**
   - Imports: `paymentRequestStorage`
   - **Fix**: Temporarily disable or show "Coming Soon"

6. **PaymentRequestsSection.tsx**
   - Imports: `paymentRequestStorage`, `nftStorage`
   - **Fix**: Temporarily disable entire section

7. **SplitBillModal.tsx**
   - Imports: `billSplitStorage`
   - **Fix**: Temporarily disable feature

8. **UpiMappingSection.tsx**
   - Imports: `upiStorage`
   - **Fix**: Temporarily disable UPI mapping

### Pages That Need Updates
9. **SimpleDashboard.tsx**
   - Imports: `balanceStorage`, `nftStorage`
   - **Fix**: Remove imports, use `getAccountBalance()` from `walletUtils.ts`

10. **UpiDashboard.tsx**
    - Imports: `upiStorage` (heavy dependency)
    - **Fix**: Temporarily disable entire page or show "Coming Soon"

## üîß Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended for now)
1. Create simplified versions of each component that:
   - Show "Feature Coming Soon" messages
   - Remove all broken imports
   - Keep wallet creation and balance checking (already working)

### Option 2: Implement Real Blockchain Features
For each feature, implement proper blockchain integration:
- **Sending**: Use Aptos SDK to create and sign real transactions
- **Transactions**: Already working via `getAccountTransactions()` in `walletUtils.ts`
- **Balance**: Already working via `getAccountBalance()` in `walletUtils.ts`
- **Payment Requests**: Requires smart contract or off-chain solution
- **UPI Integration**: Requires centralized registry or smart contract
- **NFT Rewards**: Requires NFT smart contract deployment

## üìù Current State

### What Works ‚úÖ
- Wallet creation and storage in localStorage
- Real balance fetching from blockchain
- Real transaction history from blockchain  
- Account switching
- Wallet backup (seed phrase)

### What Needs Implementation üöß
- Actual transaction sending (currently mocked)
- Payment requests (was localStorage only)
- UPI ID mapping (was localStorage only)
- Bill splitting (was localStorage only)
- NFT rewards (was localStorage only)
- Transaction simulation (was localStorage only)

## üéØ Final Goal

All features should either:
1. Use real blockchain interactions via Aptos SDK
2. Use a proper backend API
3. Be temporarily disabled with clear "Coming Soon" messaging
4. Be removed if not essential

**NO localStorage mocking should remain** (except for wallet creation which is intentionally kept).

## üí° Quick Commands to Run

To see all files with broken imports:
```bash
# Search for deleted imports
grep -r "from.*balanceStorage" frontend/src/
grep -r "from.*transactionStorage" frontend/src/
grep -r "from.*paymentRequestStorage" frontend/src/
grep -r "from.*upiStorage" frontend/src/
grep -r "from.*billSplitStorage" frontend/src/
grep -r "from.*nftStorage" frontend/src/
grep -r "from.*receiveTransactionUtils" frontend/src/
```

## Next: Fix Each Component

Each component needs to be individually fixed by removing the broken imports and either:
1. Implementing real blockchain functionality
2. Showing "Coming Soon" placeholder
3. Removing the feature entirely

Would you like me to fix them one by one?
